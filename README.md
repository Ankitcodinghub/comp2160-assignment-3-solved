<li>Late assignments are not accepted. The due date is enforced electronically.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li>Designing interfaces and building implementations.</li>
<li>Multi-file compilation.</li>
<li>Testing.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="question-1-container">Question 1: Container</h1>
For question 1, you‚Äôre going to write an interface for an abstract data type (a ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(abstract_data_type)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Container</a>‚Äù), and you‚Äôre going to provide an implementation of that ADT with a linked list.

<h2 id="the-interface">The interface</h2>
First, you should build an interface for the container ADT. Your container will store&nbsp;<em>strings</em>&nbsp;(as&nbsp;<code>char*</code>).

We‚Äôll give you the names of the functions below, but&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>&nbsp;must write complete prototypes for your interface. Choosing the return types and parameter types is your responsibility.

Your interface should contain the&nbsp;<em>minimal</em>&nbsp;amount of information required for someone to use your implementation in their code.

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
Your interface should be implemented as&nbsp;<code>container.h</code>&nbsp;with the following function&nbsp;<em>names</em>:

<h4 id="creating-and-destroying">Creating and destroying:</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>createContainer</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Create a new instance of the container)</ins></li>
<li><code>destroyContainer</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Destroy the container and its contents)</ins></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="manipulation">Manipulation:</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>insert</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Insert an item into the container)</ins></li>
<li><code>delete</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Remove the specified item from the container, only one if there are multiple)</ins></li>
<li><code>clear</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Remove&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;items from the container)</ins></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="iterating-and-searching">Iterating and searching:</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>firstItem</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Start iterating over items in the container)</ins></li>
<li><code>nextItem</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Continue iterating over items in the container)</ins></li>
<li><code>contains</code>&nbsp;<ins>(Does the container contain this item?)</ins></li>
<li><code>size</code>&nbsp;<ins>(how many items are in the container?)</ins></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h2>
Once you‚Äôve got an interface, create an implementation for the container by implementing a&nbsp;<strong>linked list</strong>&nbsp;of strings. Your implementation should define the data structure, and implement all of the functions declared as prototypes in the interface.

Your linked list implementation must apply the principles of design by contract. In particular, you should be implementing a function invariant on the linked list.

Your implementation should be implemented as&nbsp;<code>container.c</code>.

<h2 id="the-tests">The tests</h2>
Finally, you should build an automated test suite for your container implementation.

Your test suite should be implemented in a file called&nbsp;<code>main.c</code>, and you should be sure to test all functions in the file with both general case and edge case test data.

Tests should be organized appropriately into their own functions.

Your test suite should report:

<ol type="1">
<li>Progress: a statement about what the test is testing (i.e., ‚Äúsearching for X‚Äù)</li>
<li>Success: a statement about whether or not the test succeeded (i.e., ‚ÄúFAILED: expected to find X, but could not find it.‚Äù or ‚ÄúSUCCESS: expected to find X and found it.‚Äù)</li>
<li>Summary: a summary of the number of tests run, the number of tests passed, and the number of tests failed.</li>
</ol>
You should refer back to the Levenshtein implementation in Assignment 1 to get an idea of what a testing suite that matches this description looks like.

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
Your solution for question 1 must include a&nbsp;<code>Makefile</code>. The grader should only have to type the command&nbsp;<code>make</code>&nbsp;in your directory to build your assignment.

<h1 id="question-2-black-box-testing">Question 2: Black-box testing</h1>
You have been provided with an implementation of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set ADT</a>&nbsp;developed by a third-party. The implementation consists of a header file&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/le/content/518960/viewContent/3165703/View" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>set.h</code></a>&nbsp;that defines the interface and a compiled object file with the implementation.

Your job is to verify that the third-party developer is not a terrible programmer (hint: they&nbsp;<em>aren‚Äôt</em>&nbsp;terrible, they‚Äôre&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>&nbsp;terrible).

You should implement a complete test suite for the set ADT and provide a report (in a&nbsp;<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown-formatted</a>&nbsp;<code>README</code>&nbsp;file) explaining what is broken with the implementation of the set that this&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>,&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;terrible programmer has given to you.

You should use the testing suite you built in question 1 as a basis for the testing suite you build here.

<h2 id="the-first-set">The first set</h2>
You have been provided with&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;implementation of the set by a&nbsp;<em>competent</em>&nbsp;programmer. The implementation is in a file called&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/le/content/518960/viewContent/3165705/View" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>set.o</code></a>&nbsp;that has been compiled on aviary (Linux). The first implementation that you‚Äôre being provided with is 100% correct ‚Äì none of the functions in this file are implemented incorrectly, there are no bugs in this implementation.

<h2 id="the-tests-1">The tests</h2>
Your job is to write a complete test suite for the implementation of a set.

Your test suite should be implemented in a file called&nbsp;<code>main.c</code>, and you should be sure to test all functions in the file with both general case and edge case test data. Also note that there‚Äôs a function called&nbsp;<code>validateMemUse()</code>&nbsp;that can be used to verify that all instances of&nbsp;<code>Set</code>&nbsp;that were created have been destroyed ‚Äì your test suite should use this function to check for memory leaks.

Tests should be organized appropriately into their own functions.

Your test suite should report:

<ol type="1">
<li>Progress: a statement about what the test is testing (i.e., ‚Äúsearching for X‚Äù)</li>
<li>Success: a statement about whether or not the test succeeded (i.e., ‚ÄúFAILED: expected to find X, but could not find it.‚Äù or ‚ÄúSUCCESS: expected to find X and found it.‚Äù)</li>
<li>Summary: a summary of the number of tests run, the number of tests passed, and the number of tests failed.</li>
</ol>
For the set implementation that‚Äôs provided above, all of the tests you write&nbsp;<strong>will pass</strong>.

<h2 id="the-other-sets">The&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;sets</h2>
Closer to the due date, we will provide you with 5 more implementations of a set that implement the same interface. You will use the test suite that you wrote for the&nbsp;<em>correct</em>&nbsp;implementation of a set to determine what (if anything) is wrong with each of the set implementations that you‚Äôre provided with.

You must write a brief analysis for each file in a file called&nbsp;<code>README.md</code>.&nbsp;<code>README.md</code>&nbsp;should be a&nbsp;<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown-formatted</a>&nbsp;file (use headings!).

While the code we will provide to you is&nbsp;<em>buggy</em>, it&nbsp;<strong>will not crash</strong>. If you receive any error messages (segmentation fault, abort, bus error), the crash is happening in&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;code. When this happens, your strategy should be to re-read the comments in the set interface to better understand what each function does/requires. If you still can‚Äôt figure out why your tests are crashing, you should pull out your debugger and debug your code.

<h1 id="submitting-your-assignment">Submitting your assignment</h1>
Create a directory called&nbsp;<code>comp2160-a3-&lt;yourlastname&gt;-&lt;yourstudentid&gt;</code>. Within that directory, create a directory for each of Q1 and Q2, where you will put your respective files for each problem.

Then run the command:

<div id="cb1" class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex">handin</span> 2160 A3 comp2160-a3-<span class="op">&lt;</span>yourlastname<span class="op">&gt;</span>-<span class="op">&lt;</span>yourstudentid<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
<li>You may optionally include a&nbsp;<code>README</code>&nbsp;file in the root of your directory that explains anything unusual about compiling or running your programs.</li>
<li>You may resubmit your assignment as many times as you want, but&nbsp;<strong>only the latest</strong>&nbsp;submission will be kept.</li>
<li>We only accept homework submissions via&nbsp;<code>handin</code>. Please&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;e-mail your homework to the instructor or TAs ‚Äì it will be ignored.</li>
<li>You&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;submit an Honesty Declaration (digitally on UM Learn). Assignments submitted without a corresponding Honesty Declaration&nbsp;<strong>will not be graded</strong>.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to refuse to grade the homework, or to deduct marks if these instructions are not followed.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>
Your assignment is worth 30 points, 15 points √ó 2.

Note that your code&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;compile ‚Äì no part marks will be given for code that does not compile.

Note further that your code&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;compile with&nbsp;<code>make</code>. Graders&nbsp;<strong>will not</strong>&nbsp;manually compile any code by running&nbsp;<code>clang</code>&nbsp;for this assignment,&nbsp;<em>even if</em>&nbsp;you write instructions in the&nbsp;<code>README</code>.

<h2 id="warnings">Warnings</h2>
The code you write should compile with&nbsp;<code>clang -Wall</code>&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;any warnings. A 1 point penalty will be applied to your score (before multiplication) for&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;warning that is emitted by the compiler.
